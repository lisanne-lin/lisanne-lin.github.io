# SmartShip

Developing a dashboard for ship captains using SmartShip controls

---

## The project
This project was made in a group of five for a real company <a href="https://www.smart-ship.eu">SmartShip</a>.

Our team developed the SmartShip dashboard that offers a centralized location for viewing and customizing relevant ship data. To enhance user experience, we incorporated drag-and-drop functionality into our customizable design, a profile page where operators can track their todo's, notification center to see all important notifications and more.

### App features

-   Dashboard is fully customizable with drag and drop

-   Notification center shows information and warns the operator if a parameter drops below a certain value

-   Profile page to track todo's and notifications

-   Managers can manage the accounts of operators by deleting their account, or assigning them to another ship

### My contribution
I created the profile page for the project. It displays the user information, along with a notification component which displays 2 most recent notifications. It also features a todo list, where operators can add, delete and edit todos, as well as adding a date if needed.

### What I learned

-   I have learned how to work with Vue.js. It's a pretty fun framework and I could see myself using it again on other web-projects

-   I need to improve my time management skills since my poor time management has resulted in me not contributing as
    much to the project as I had hoped to.
